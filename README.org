* Easy setup
  #+begin_src emacs-lisp
    (define-key ytel-mode-map (kbd "RET") #'ytel-show)
  #+end_src

  *OR*

  #+begin_src emacs-lisp
    (use-package ytel-show
      :after ytel
      :bind (:map ytel-mode-map ("RET" . ytel-show)))
  #+end_src

* Usage
** Ytel-Show
   - /n|p/ :: switch videos
   - /G/ :: recache video information
** Ytel-Show-Comments
   - /l/ :: go to previous page
   - /g/ :: retry downloading failed page

* Customization
  Default buffer name: ~ytel-show-default-buffer-name~,
  ~ytel-show-comments-default-buffer-name~.

  Thumbnail sizes: ~ytel-show-image-max-width~, ~ytel-show-image-max-height~

  Faces: ~ytel-show-video-likes-face~, ~ytel-show-author-subs-face~,
  ~ytel-show-comments-owner-face~

* Extensibility
  You can easily extend this package by giving ~ytel-show~ function a ~buffer~
  argument and a vector of ~video-ids~.  Your videos will be display in a new
  buffer.  For example: you could customize ~browse-url-browser-function~ to
  detect youtube video urls and display them using ~ytel-show~.

  Same thing with ~ytel-show-comments~.  It takes ~id~, ~title~ and a ~buffer~.
* Note
  Viewed videos are set with ~ytel-show~ command.  In order to load videos from
  other *ytel* pages, you should switch page in *ytel* buffer and call
  ~ytel-show~ again.

  Same thing with ~ytel-show-comments~ command.  It sets all the necessary
  information.
* Caveats
  Sometimes json-reader will fail to parse a response from invidious instance or
  the connection will timeout.  You will see an almost empty buffer.  Usually,
  hitting the /G/ (~ytel-show-reload-video-data~) key a couple of times helps.

  Sometimes invidous instance will send empty author thumbnail urls, so they
  will not be shown.

  If the first comments page won't load properly, try hitting /g/.

  Currently, I don't have a solution for these problems.

* Bugs
