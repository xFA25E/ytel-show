* ytel-show
  A package that lets you view video information from [[https://github.com/gRastello/ytel][ytel]].

  [[./ytel-show-screenshot.png]]

* Easy setup
  ~(define-key ytel-mode-map (kbd "RET") #'ytel-show)~

  *OR*

  #+begin_src emacs-lisp
    (use-package ytel-show
      :after ytel
      :bind (:map ytel-mode-map ("RET" . ytel-show)))
  #+end_src

* Usage
  - /n|p/ :: switch videos
  - /G/ :: to recache video information

* Extensibility
  You can easily extend this package for showing videos from other places.  Just
  give ~ytel-show~ function a ~buffer~ argument and your vector of ~video-ids~
  and your videos will be displayed.

* Note
  Viewed videos are set with ~ytel-show~ command.  In order to go to next videos
  page, you should first switch page in *ytel* buffer and then call ~ytel-show~
  again.

* Caveats
  Sometimes json-reader will fail to parse a response from invidious instance or
  the connection will timeout.  You will see an almost empty buffer.  Usually,
  hitting the /G/ (~ytel-show-reload-video-data~) key a couple of times helps.
  Currently, I don't have a solution for this.

* Todo [8/12]
  - [ ] add youtube comments
  - [ ] test more and run flycheck
  - [ ] add fancy graphics and styles with faces (update screenshot)
  - [ ] better thumbnail selection ::
    Sometimes maxres/maxresdefault thumbnails are empty.  During updates, if the
    returned thumbnail is nil, and there is already a cached thumbnail, dont
    update.

    Sometimes, the author's thumbnail will be with a double-slash prefix.  Maybe
    I should simply detect such thumbnails and prepend https: to them.

    Sometimes, urls are prefixed with single-slash. These are probably should be
    prefixed with https://i.ytimg.com

    Add interactive thumbnail selection
  - [X] improve readme (describe caveats and add screenshot, dependencies, bugreports)
  - [X] `ytel-show` should take a buffer name (describe this in docs)
  - [X] check `ytel-show` errors
  - [X] add autoloads
  - [X] write documentation
  - [X] add custom variables
  - [X] add log messages
